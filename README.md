Project created using Java and MySQL.

To run, download MAMP and set up a local server using either port 80 or 8080 for "Apache and Nginx" and port 3306 for "MySQL".
The jdbc jar file is included along with the SQL Database called "animal".
Once MAMP WebStart page is launched, go to tools --> access phpMyAdmin --> Databases and create a new database called "animal_queue". Import the animal SQL Database.

Open the "dist" folder -> AnimalQueue (Executable Jar File) and launch the file to open the project.
